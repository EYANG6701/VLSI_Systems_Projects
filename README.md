# ECSE485 Labs
Hi, my name is Eric Yang, and this is a repository to showcase my ECSE485 (VLSI Systems) projects that I've completed at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) during the Fall 2025 semester.

These labs have taught me how to use Siemens S-Edit, T-Spice, and L-Edit, and the following projects will show you the circuits I have built.
